# Organisation AI

Organisation AI is a free, open-source web application that empowers your entire organisation with access to advanced AI chat capabilities&mdash;without the burden of costly per-user licenses.

Bring your own OpenAI key and deploy effortlessly to Microsoft Azure.

Originally known as *Teacher AI* for its focus on supporting staff in schools, this app has been upgraded to meet the needs of any organisation, from businesses to nonprofits.

### Features

* A clean, professional chat interface
* Access to the latest OpenAI language models
* Customisable prompt presets for different teams
* Web search capabilities
* Understanding of uploaded images
* Document search using vector stores
* Chat history
* Automated content moderation and manual review
* Configurable weekly spend limits
* Support for all screen sizes, including mobile
* Single sign-on (SSO) using Microsoft 365

### Setup

1. Create an OpenAI account and generate an API key.

2. Create a general purpose v2 storage account in Microsoft Azure, and within it create:
    * Tables: `conversations`, `spend`, and `review`
    * Blob containers: `conversations` and `config`

3. Within the `config` blob container, upload a blank file `keys.xml`. Generate a SAS URL for this file with read/write permissions and a distant expiry. This will be used to store the application's data protection keys so that auth cookies persist across app restarts.


4. Within the `config` blob container, create a file `users.csv` with the following format:

    ```csv
    Email,UserGroup
    test@example.com,staff
    ```

5. For each user group configured in `users.csv`, create a file `<usergroup>.json` with the following format:

    ```json
    {
      "allowUploads": true,
      "introMessage": "This service is for work-related queries only.",
      "moderationThreshold": 0.7,
      "presets": [
        {
          "id": "default",
          "title": null,
          "category": null,
          "introduction": null,
          "instructions": "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
          "model": "gpt-4.1",
          "temperature": 0.2,
          "reasoningEffort": null,
          "webSearchEnabled": false,
          "vectorStoreId": null
        }
      ],
      "reviewers": [ "reviewer@example.com" ],
      "reviewThreshold": 0,
      "showPresetDetails": true,
      "stopCommands": [
        "token": "[offtopic]",
        "message": "This is off-topic."
      ],
      "userMaxWeeklySpend": 2.00
    }
    ```

    Our [examples](examples) folder contains sample configuration files for a secondary school.

    The settings are:

    * `allowUploads` - whether users in this group can upload files
    * `introMessage` - a message to display to users on the homepage in Markdown format, e.g. you may include a link to your organisation's AI policy
    * `moderationThreshold` - how certain the moderation model must be that a message is inappropriate before rejecting it and stopping the conversation (low values like 0.4 provide the most protection, whereas high values like 0.8 minimise false positives)
    * `presets` - an array of preset prompt templates that will be available to users from the sidebar
        * `id` - the ID of the preset, which is a unique string without spaces; use the ID `default` to specify the default preset which loads at the start
        * `title` - the title of the preset, displayed in the sidebar
        * `category` - the category of the preset, displayed as a heading in the sidebar
        * `introduction` - the message to display when this preset is selected, in Markdown format (note that this is not sent to the language model)
        * `instructions` - the system instructions to send to the language model along with the user's message
        * `model` - the OpenAI model to use for this preset, as configured below
        * `temperature` (optional) - the temperature to use, where supported by the model
        * `reasoningEffort` (optional) - the reasoning effort to use, where supported by the model
        * `webSearchEnabled` (optional) - whether web searches are enabled
        * `vectorStoreId` (optional) - the ID of the OpenAI vector store to use for this preset
    * `reviewers` - an array of users to give reviewer access, which allows them to retrospectively review all AI conversations in this group
    * `reviewThreshold` - how certain the moderation model must be that a message is inappropriate before adding it to the queue for manual review (set this to 0 if you wish to review all messages)
    * `showPresetDetails` - whether to show the preset details, such as the system instructions and model name, to the user
    * `stopCommands` - specific strings that, if received from the language model, will stop the conversation and display a customised message; this needs to be used in conjunction with the model `instructions` above, and can be useful for safety purposes
        * `token` - the exact text to match in the language model's output (e.g. `[OFF TOPIC]`)
        * `message` - the warning to display to the user, in Markdown format
    * `userMaxWeeklySpend` - the amount each user is allowed to spend per week; resets Sundays (OpenAI token usage is retrospective, so users might slightly exceed the limit before restrictions apply)
 
6. Create an Azure app registration.
    * Name - `Organisation AI`
    * Redirect URI - `https://<app-website-domain>/signin-oidc`
    * Implicit grant - ID tokens
    * Supported account types - Accounts in this organizational directory only
    * API permissions - `Microsoft Graph - User.Read`
    * Token configuration - add an optional claim of type ID: `upn`

7. Create an Azure App Service web app.
    * Publish mode - Container
    * Operating system - Linux
    * Image source - Other container registries
    * Docker Hub access type - Public
    * Image and tag - `jamesgurung/organisation-ai:latest`
    * Startup command: (blank)

8. Configure the following environment variables for the web app:

    * `Organisation__Name` - the name of your organisation
    * `Organisation__AppWebsite` - the host name where this app will be hosted, e.g. `example.com`
    * `Organisation__Reviewers__0` - the email address of a user to give reviewer access, which allows them to review all users' AI conversations (subsequent reviewers can be configured by adding additional items with incrementing indices)
    * `Organisation__CountryCode` - your country code, e.g. `GB` for Great Britain (used for localised web search)
    * `Organisation__City` - your city name (used for localised web search)
    * `Organisation__Timezone` - your timezone, e.g. `Europe/London` (used for localised web search)
    * `Azure__ClientId` - the client ID of your Azure app registration
    * `Azure__TenantId` - your Azure tenant ID
    * `Azure__StorageAccountName` - the name of your Azure Storage account
    * `Azure__StorageAccountKey` - the key for your Azure Storage account
    * `Azure__DataProtectionBlobUri` - the SAS URL for the keys file you created earlier
    * `OpenAI__ApiKey` - the API key for your OpenAI account
    * `OpenAI__CostPer1KFileSearches` - the OpenAI credit cost per 1K file searches
    * `OpenAI__TitleSummarisationModel` - the model which will be used to summarise titles, e.g. `gpt-4.1-nano`
    * `OpenAI__Models__0__Name` - the name of an OpenAI model you would like to make available, e.g. `gpt-4.1` (subsequent models can be configured by adding additional items with incrementing indices)
    * `OpenAI__Models__0__CostPer1MInputTokens` - the model cost per 1M input tokens
    * `OpenAI__Models__0__CostPer1MCachedInputTokens` - the model cost per 1M cached input tokens
    * `OpenAI__Models__0__CostPer1MOutputTokens` - the model cost per 1M output tokens
    * `OpenAI__Models__0__CostPer1KWebSearches` - the model cost per 1K web searches (if the model does not support web searches, omit this setting)

### Updating configuration files

To make changes to users or user groups after deployment, you can edit the files in the `config` blob container. A user with reviewer access must then navigate to `/api/refresh` for the changes to take effect.
