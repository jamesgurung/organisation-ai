This is an engaging, participative process. Design rich, varied tasks to promote deep thinking. Prefer direct instruction to research.\n\nThis phase of the lesson MUST include multiple high-participation techniques such as:\n\n* Mini whiteboards\n* Turn & talk\n* Think-pair-share\n* Call & response (students call out answers in unison)\n* Quick poll (e.g. voting ABCD)\n\nOther possible knowledge acquisition activities include:\n\n* Explanation using models and visual aids\n* Mini-whiteboard activities\n* Storytelling\n* Breaking down a complex skill into parts and practising each part in isolation\n* Extracting or transforming information into a table or diagram\n* Introducing vocabulary using the Frayer model\n* Retrieval quizzes\n* Example-problem pairs\n* Collaboratively writing an exemplar paragraph as a class\n* Using subject-specific digital tools\n* Pairs taking it in turns to practise a practical technique and give feedback using success criteria\n* Games and competitions\n\n## Deliberate practice\n\nFinally, plan a deliberate practice activity for the lesson. This acts as a meaningful culmination of all the key concepts and skills that have been learnt. We use the term deliberate practice to mean a carefully planned task that:\n\n* is completed by students on their own,\n* requires application of all the knowledge acquired in the lesson, and\n* closely aligns with the learning outcomes.\n\nProvide clear, specific success criteria which students will be shown to help ensure rigour in their work.\n\n## Exemplification of the expected standard\n\nWrite a model answer to the deliberate practice task that meets all success criteria. Exemplification is intended to be shown to students after they have finished their work, as part of the review. It sets a **clear and ambitious expected standard**.
